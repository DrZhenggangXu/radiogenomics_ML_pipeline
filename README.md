Ten different machine learning algorithms were employed for classification modeling to identify the best-performing model. These algorithms included logistic regression (LR), LASSO, ridge regression, elastic net, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), random forest (RF), classification and regression trees (CART), naive Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN).
